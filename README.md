# fChat
A new, hip chatting platform.

## What makes fChat different?
fChat was developed by a student, with students in mind. The objective of this application was to create a chatting platform that was fun and easy to use. No more complicated invites, just come up with a chat id (for example: the_best_chat_ever) and share it with your friends!

## How does it work?
First, open the app and login/sign up. The authentication and user creation is handled/stored in Firebase which encrypts all of the auth data. Once you are logged in, click on the + button to create or join a chat. The screen will refresh and you will be able to enter the chat and begin sending messages. Continue to send messages to your heart's content!

## What's next?
As fChat continues to grow, there are a couple of things that I would like to add:
 - Optional Passwords for Chats:
 Users will be able to password protect their chats so that people cannot join unexpectedly
 - Unique display names and tagging others
 Users will be able to tag each other directly based on their unique display names.

fChat was developed for the ICS4UI summative project, using Android Studio
